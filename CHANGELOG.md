# Change Log

## 2.0 (2021-08-29)

- Added possibility in config file to buy multiple coins at the same time
- Fixed spelling issues. This results in previous config files being incompatible. Change "ammount" to "amount" to migrate.
- Fixed an issue, where the limit buy would get a "Filter failure: LOT_SIZE, result code: 400" on some coins where the order's step size was too high res.
- Requiring Python 3.9 now.

## 1.0
